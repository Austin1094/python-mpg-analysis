## Description
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of fuel economy trends using the mpg dataset. My analysis delved into various aspects of fuel efficiency, including its relationship with factors such as horsepower, number of cylinders, model year, and country of origin. 

I began by visualizing how fuel economy has changed over time, revealing insights into the evolution of vehicle efficiency across different model years. Additionally, I explored the impact of engine characteristics on fuel economy by examining the distribution of mpg across different numbers of cylinders using box plots.

Furthermore, I investigated how fuel economy varies among vehicles from different countries of origin, providing valuable insights into regional differences in vehicle efficiency standards.

Through analysis, I gained a deeper understanding of the factors influencing fuel economy and uncovered key insights into trends and patterns within the automotive industry. The findings have implications for understanding vehicle design considerations, policy-making related to environmental sustainability, and consumer choices in selecting fuel-efficient vehicles.
